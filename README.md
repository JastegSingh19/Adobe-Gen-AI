Shape Detection and Processing
==============================

Welcome to the Shape Detection and Processing project! This project is divided into three main sections: **Isolation**, **Fragmented**, and **Occluded** shapes. Each section contains specific tasks related to detecting and processing 2D shapes from curves. The project focuses on developing algorithms for identifying and analyzing various geometric shapes in different scenarios.

Project Structure
-----------------

-   **Isolation:** Identifying regular shapes in a given set of curves.
-   **Fragmented:** Identifying the presence of symmetry in closed shapes.
-   **Occlusion:** Completing curves with gaps or partial holes due to occlusion removal.

Sections Overview
-----------------

### 1\. Isolation

The Isolation section leverages the `ShapeDetector` class, a Python tool designed to detect and classify various geometric shapes from a set of 2D points. This class is capable of identifying circles, rectangles, stars, lines, and ellipses from given path data. Additionally, it offers functionalities to merge similar shapes, update paths based on detected shapes, and visualize the results.
